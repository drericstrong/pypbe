PyePBE
==================================

PyPBE is a resource for tabletop gaming which allows Gamemasters (GM) to fairly select which random rolling method is closest to an equivalent Point Buy value. Ideally, all players will determine their character's stats exactly the same way. However, in some cases, players may ask for several different options for generating their character's stats. PyPBE is designed to allow GMs to make this decision in a fair way. By calculating the equivalent Point Buy for a random rolling method, the GM can determine the expected power level of the characters, as well.

PyPBE is designed for Pathfinder, 3e, 3.5e, 4e, and 5e characters. However, the Python API allows the option to supply a custom Point Buy mapping, which means that it is applicable for any system in which the "Point Buy" concept applies. PyPBE also supports any number of attributes, although it was designed for the common 6-attribute system (strength, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, charisma).
