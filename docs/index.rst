==================================

*Sarah, John, and Kara sit down to play the first session of a new Pathfinder campaign with their GM, Lee. Sarah is excited about playing her favorite class, a Ranger. It doesn't matter what stats she rolls- she'll make it work. John is a bit of a min-maxer and wants to roll up a Wizard, so he's keen on getting the highest intelligence possible. Kara wants to play a Monk, which requires decent stats in a few different attributes.* 

*Lee decides that he wants the players to randomly roll for their character's stats. Sarah is excited about the chance for high stats. She's feeling especially lucky today. John, however, is angry. What if he doesn't roll any 18s for his intelligence? Kara is worried. She really wants to play a Monk, but she wants the character to be effective, and bad rolls could significantly reduce the fun she'll have playing the character.*

*What should Lee do?*

PyPBE is a resource for tabletop gaming which allows Gamemasters (GM) to fairly select which random rolling method is closest to an equivalent Point Buy value. Ideally, all players will determine their character's stats exactly the same way. However, in some cases (as in the story above), players may ask for several different options for generating their character's stats. PyPBE is designed to allow GMs to make this decision in a fair way.

As you work with PyPBE, you might also become concerned about the high variance inherent with every one of these methods and decide that you don't ever want random rolling in your game.
